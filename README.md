## 🧠 Background and Motivation
At UNSW, group assignments often follow a familiar and frustrating pattern: students are randomly grouped together with little to no insight into each other's strengths or working styles. With tight deadlines and limited coordination, teams are expected to complete complex tasks while relying heavily on one another. 

Projectemon was created to tackle these issues head-on by providing a student-friendly, Pokémon-themed project management tool. By making task tracking and team coordination more engaging and intuitive, Projectemon encourages collaboration, effective task management, and individual accountability.
